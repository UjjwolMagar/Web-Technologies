<h1>Thomas J. Watson sr.</h1>
<p>There is a future for every man in this building. — Thomas J. Watson Sr., 1920s Between 1914 and 1924, C-T-R evolved into IBM. The three little firms acquired a new culture, team of executives, and updated products that put it on its path to becoming an iconic American company. IBM's experience demonstrates that small companies sometimes transform slowly in response to changing economic conditions because they are fraught with internal politics and buffeted by complex market circumstances. It was not clear in 1914 what IBM's transformation should look like. George W. Fairchild and other managers across C-T-R resisted changes. Similar battles occurred throughout IBM's history, too.</p>
