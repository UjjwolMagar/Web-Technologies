ALT
Browsers do not always display images. There are a number of situations in which a browser might not display images, such as:
Non-visual browsers (such as those used by people with visual impairments)
The user chooses not to display images (saving bandwidth, privacy reasons)
The image is invalid or an unsupported type
In these cases, the browser may replace the image with the text in the element's alt attribute. 
For these reasons and others, provide a useful value for alt whenever possible.

TITLE
Its purpose is to describe the image textually so that search engines and screen readers 
(software used by the visually impaired) can understand what they're viewing.
